      <title>Friendly Python Clojures in an automatic Text Annotator</title>

      <description>While creating some pipelines for automatic text annotation, I encountered a bug that made me realise that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get the gist of a basic block of programming.
It&amp;rsquo;s closures. They&amp;rsquo;re there thanks to your language having first-class functions and you may have encountered them in academia or some programming tutorial, even used them in some toy examples. I know I had. Closures in a sandbox are straight forward. Still, you may not know their power until you&amp;rsquo;d seen them in the wild.</description>

      <title>Do not base your life on statistics</title>

      <description>Statistics is based on probability. Probability is a purely epistemological measure. Meaning that probability is not connected to the object, but it&amp;rsquo;s just a measure of how strong is the evidence for some belief related to the analysed object.
Take an example: what&amp;rsquo;s the probability of you dying in a car crash? Noow what;s the probability of you dying in a car crash given that you have broken breaks and you are going down a hill?</description>
