      <description>Statistics is based on probability. Probability is a purely epistemological measure. Meaning that probability is not connected to the object, but it&amp;rsquo;s just a measure of how strong is the evidence for some belief related to the analysed object.
Take an example: what&amp;rsquo;s the probability of you dying in a car crash? Noow what;s the probability of you dying in a car crash given that you have broken breaks and you are going down a hill?</description>
